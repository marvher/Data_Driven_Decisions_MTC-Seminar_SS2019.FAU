## Abstract

The task is to find out which crimes are committed in Chicago and where or when they are committed. 
A US non-governmental organization (NGO) has been commissioned to investigate crime in this major city. Once known as a major automobile metropolis, the city has been struggling with rising crime rates for many years, and residents are becoming increasingly concerned. In order to give the citizens more confidence in the police, data-based decisions are to be made on where new officers should be deployed and where more controls are needed.

Please note: All project files are in German, as this was the language of the course.
